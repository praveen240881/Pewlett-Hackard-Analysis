# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative. 
The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.
Results:
• Comparing the percent eligible retirees against their titles, it will affect the Engineering department the most which could potentially affect their ability to do research and development and eventually the Bottom Line.
• Looking at the total number of eligible mentorships, 1,940 mentees will barely cover the gap of the eligible retirees. If Pewlett-Hackard will compensate the lost by training from withing, the Bobby will need to widen the search parameter.
Summary:
At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, 64% of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives, which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come.
